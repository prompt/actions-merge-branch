### Synchronise `release` branch with `main`

Every push to `main` is synchronised to the `release` branch by merging in any
changes.

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"

jobs:
  synchronise-release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          ref: "release"
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: prompt/actions-merge-branch@v2
        with:
          from: "origin/main"
```
